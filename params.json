{"name":"RADnome","tagline":"We empower ddRADtags with PE sequencing ","body":"### Welcome to RADnome.\r\n\r\nTraditional approaches for analyzing restriction site associated DNA markers ([RADtags][1]) were designed for either single end sequencing or for contigs assembled from single digest RADs. However, new methods using double digest methods ([ddRADseq][2] **other paper?**) produce RADs where individual PE reads are non-overlapping.\r\n\r\nTo address this problem this software independently infers contigs for each R1 and R2 read using [rainbow][3]. Contigs representing read pairs are then associated based on read mapping positions. After contigs are paired, all contigs are merged into a pseudo-genome (= RADnome). Individual samples are then mapped to this RADnome and software packages such as [GATK][4] can be used to identify SNVs.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\n*  Email: **some email address**\r\n*  Twitter: [RADnome][5]\r\n*  Github: [github.com/ngcrawford/RADnome][6]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was conceived Brian Simison (@wbsimey) and Nicholas Crawford (@ngcrawford) with contributions from Josh Pollock (@iliketurkey).\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_site_associated_DNA_markers\r\n[2]: http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0037135\r\n[3]: dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bts482\r\n[4]: http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/\r\n[5]: https://twitter.com/RADnome\r\n[6]: https://github.com/ngcrawford/RADnome","google":"UA-41852012-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
